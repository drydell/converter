SHORTCUTS AND IMPROVEMENTS
==================================================================

The logic here is pretty much how I would have coded a real site.
The only real shortcut is using CRA instead of Next or another React framework, especially since this is a Single Page Application.
There also is no true UI/UX design, it's basically just put together in the order I wrote things.

1. Make Polling interval and history size configurable
2. Add User signon with preferences of all configurable options
